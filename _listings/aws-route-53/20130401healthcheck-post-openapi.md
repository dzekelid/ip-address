  title: AWS Route 53 API Create Health Check
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Creates a new health check.To create a new health check, send a POST
    request to the/2013-04-01/healthcheck resource. The request body must include
    a documentwith a CreateHealthCheckRequest element. The response returns theCreateHealthCheckResponse
    element, containing the health check ID specifiedwhen adding health check to a
    resource record set. For information about adding health checksto resource record
    sets, see ResourceRecordSet:HealthCheckId in ChangeResourceRecordSets. If you
    are registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) loadbalancer,
    do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register
    anEC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health
    check, whichperforms a similar function to an Amazon Route 53 health check.You
    can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a private hostedzone.
    Note the following:Amazon Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check
    the health of an endpointwithin a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public
    IP address to the instance in theVPC.You can configure a health checker to check
    the health of an external resource thatthe instance relies on, such as a database
    server.You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric,
    and then create ahealth check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example,
    you might create a CloudWatchmetric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed
    metric, add analarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based
    on the state of thealarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and
    alarms by using the CloudWatch console,see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
